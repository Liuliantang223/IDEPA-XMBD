# IDEPA-XMBD
We evaluated five state-of-the-art tools (RankComp v1/v2, PenDA, Peng, and Quantile) through classic computational (precision, Type one error control, parameter evaluation, robustness, and similarity) and functional (pathway enrichment and survival analysis) criteria. We also integrated these tools into a user-friendly tool kit, IDEPA-XMBD , to facilitate individualized DEAs in proteomics studies.
