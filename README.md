# IDEPA-XMBD: Assessing the performance of individualized differential analysis methods.

We created a fork of the IDEPA-XMBD project by Liu et al. (https://github.com/xmuyulab/IDEPA-XMBD). This tool facilitates the assessment of individualized differential analysis methods, encompassing the basic analysis processes for five such methods, the detection of Relative Expression Orders (REOs), and the precision calculation. For an in-depth analysis, refer to the original project page.


## 1. Installation

Pull the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Liuliantang223/IDEPA-XMBD.git
cd IDEPA-XMBD
```

Create a new conda environment:
```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate reoa3
```
Install R packages:
```shell
python r_package_install.py
```

### 2. Usage

(1) Find stable pairs:

Set directory in the python file, for example, '/cluster2/huanglab/jiaao/individualized_analysis/IDEPA-XMBD'.

```shell
idea_dir = '/path/to/your/IDEPA-XMBD/directory' 
```

Run the python file.
```shell
python stable_pairs_demo.py
```

(2) Run precision calculation:

Set directory in the python file, for example, '/cluster2/huanglab/jiaao/individualized_analysis/IDEPA-XMBD'.

```shell
idea_dir = '/path/to/your/IDEPA-XMBD/directory' 
```

Run the python file.
```shell
python precision_demo.py
```
